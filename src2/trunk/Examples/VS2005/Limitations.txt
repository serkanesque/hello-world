Loads the body after all external script has downloaded. It does not gradually download script, inject body and then again download script as the order is defined in the html 

It waits for scripts with "defer" attribute.

Inline script blocks are all executed at once after all external scripts download

No document.write allowed in inline script or scripts referenced

window.onload won't work. You have to use $(document).ready(...)

HTMLParser cannot parse <!DOCTYPE... directive. So, you must remove that directive from your html files.
