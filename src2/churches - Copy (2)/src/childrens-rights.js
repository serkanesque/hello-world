            <h2 id="the-convention-on-the-rights-of-the-child">1.The Convention on the Rights of the Child</h2>
          <p>Corporal punishment of children breaches their fundamental human rights to respect for their human dignity
and physical integrity and to equal protection under the law, upheld in the Universal Declaration on Human
Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other international human rights
instruments.</p>
           <p>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) explicitly requires states to protect
children from all forms of physical or mental violence (Article 19) and from torture or other cruel, inhuman
or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 37). Under Article 39, States must provide support to children
who are victims of violence. The CRC requires school discipline to be “consistent with the child’s human
dignity and in conformity with the present Convention” (Article 28.2) – that is, without using corporal
punishment</p>
            <p>The Committee on the Rights of the Child – the monitoring body for the CRC – has identified certain
rights in the CRC as general principles underpinning all rights in the Convention. There are four such general
principles. In all actions concerning children, the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration
(Article 3). Every child has an inherent right to life,
survival and development (Article 6) and to nondiscrimination (Article 2). And all children have the
right to express their views freely in all matters affecting
them and to have their views given due weight (Article
12).</p>


 <h2 id="UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child">2.UN Committee on the Rights of the Child</h2>
        <p>The Committee on the Rights of the Child monitors implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the
Child. It is the highest international authority for interpretation of the Convention. Elected by States Parties
to the Convention, the 18-member body meets three times a year in Geneva. States Parties must submit an
initial report on progress towards implementation of the Convention within two years of ratification; then
periodic reports must be submitted every five years.</p>
          <p>The Committee has consistently stated that legal and social acceptance of physical punishment of children,
in the home, institutions and all other settings, is not compatible with the Convention. Since 1993, in its
recommendations following examination of states’ reports on their efforts to implement the Convention the
Committee has recommended prohibition of physical punishment in the family, in all types of institutions,
care settings and as a sentence of the courts, together with education campaigns to encourage positive, nonviolent childrearing and education. In examining states’ reports, the Committee has singled out for particular
criticism national laws that allow some level of violent punishment justified as “reasonable chastisement” or
“moderate correction.”</p>

    
 <h2 id="Other-international-and-regional-human-rights-treaties">3. Other international and regional human rights treaties</h2>
        <p>The prohibition of all corporal punishment is required by other international human rights treaties, including
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights. In December 2008, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on the rights of
the child which urged States to take legislative measures to prohibit all forms of violence against children in
all settings, to change attitudes which “condone or normalize” violence against children, including “cruel,
inhuman or degrading forms of discipline”, and to promote positive discipline in the home, schools, and care
and justice systems. </p>  
     <p>Regional human rights treaty bodies also support prohibition and there are high level court judgments in
a growing number of states condemning corporal punishment. For example, in 1982, the European Human
Rights Commission declared inadmissible an application to the European Court of Human Rights in which
Swedish parents alleged that the prohibition of physical punishment by parents breached their rights to
respect for family life and to freedom of religion as guaranteed in articles 8 and 9 of the European Convention
on Human Rights. The parents believed that their Protestant Christian faith and particular Biblical texts
supported the use of corporal punishment.</p>
