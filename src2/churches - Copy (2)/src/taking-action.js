            <h2 id="The-importance-of-involving-religious-leaders-and-their-communities">The importance of involving religious leaders and their communities</h2>
         <p>Religion has been a major force in people’s lives for centuries and religious leaders continue to play an
influential role in the public and political sphere and on many societal levels. The views of religious leaders can
contribute towards shaping important debates and achieving justice and human rights. </p>
         <p>Many religious leaders exercise power and influence in both the religious and secular spheres at local,
regional, national and international levels and through their extensive networks. Religious leaders are also
uniquely positioned to make an effective contribution towards achieving reform to end corporal punishment
through their various roles and functions. They usually have insights and detailed knowledge of their
communities and contact with people at many points in their lives. It is important to engage with religious
leaders who are already taking a leadership role on children’s rights and to encourage their involvement in
national strategies to achieve law reform to prohibit corporal punishment of children. </p>
         <p>Religious communities may be unaware of the involvement of
others working towards eliminating corporal punishment. Building on
mutual respect and trust, organisations can work together to provide
opportunities for diverse faith communities to receive information,
resources and encouragement to become actively engaged with the issue.</p>
         <p>This section looks at opportunities available for engaging religious
support and expertise through existing structures, including religious
organisations and networks. It discusses the importance of multireligious collaboration between religious groups and between religious
groups and other organisations, gives examples of faith-based action
and advocacy, makes suggestions for further action and discusses ways
of ensuring children’s participation. The following section (Section 6)
considers in more detail how efforts to prohibit and eliminate corporal
punishment of children can be furthered through the everyday roles
and functions of religious leaders.</p>



            <h2 id="Engaging-with-faith-based-groups">Engaging with faith-based groups</h2>
         <p>Faith-based groups are multi-faceted. They include religious leaders and organisations such as charities
and welfare organisations, local religious congregations and religious institutions, theological colleges and
university departments, schools and religious orders</p>
  <p>Many faith-based organisations are concerned with supporting children and families. Leaders from
different religious traditions may also serve as chaplains or counsellors in prisons, hospitals, schools,
universities and places of work</p>
  <p>Religious leaders often fulfill roles and duties in the public sphere, placing them in a unique position
to promote dialogue and cooperation between different religious groups, community organisations and
government bodies towards eliminating violence against children. Historically many religious leaders have
made a stand for justice and human rights.</p>
    <p>Gaining the support and active involvement of religious leaders and their communities is a crucial
component of efforts to prohibit and eliminate corporal punishment of children. It is important to create
opportunities to listen to supportive religious leaders and seek their advice on the best ways to engage
with religious communities. The Kyoto Declaration and the report of the UN Secretary-General’s Study
on Violence against Children (see Section 3) can be used to highlight concerns and form a framework for
meetings and events to create awareness, provide information and develop a plan of action.</p>
<h4>Building partnerships</h4>
<p>Investing in partnerships and coalitions with religious communities and organisations brings a broader
dimension to eliminating violence against children. It can have a powerful influence as people of faith unite
behind a common goal. Working in solidarity enables different communities to learn from each other,
strengthen commitment and take action. The sharing of information, resources and training can enlarge the
capacity of religious, traditional and indigenous groups to address the issue of corporal punishment</p>
<p>Many mosques, temples, synagogues, churches and houses of worship have extensive local, regional and
global networks. They have long-standing links with education and youth networks and are traditionally
involved in charitable work and service provision. Many are in touch with some of the most marginalised
people and those who are isolated from other services. </p>

<h2 id="Developing-multi-religious-support">Developing multi-religious support</h2>
         <p>Investing in partnerships with religious communities to work towards a common goal can help recognise
the skills and expertise of religious communities. When people from different religions come together with
a common purpose and speak with one voice they can be a powerful influence in changing attitudes and
achieving reform. </p>
           <p>Women are often under-represented in religious leadership roles and multi-religious gatherings. It is
important to find ways of engaging with women of faith to ensure they are included in all meetings and
decision-making processes. </p>
             <p>Multi-religious action can take place at local, regional, national and international levels. For example,
global organisations and networks can provide opportunities at conferences and workshops to develop joint
declarations, recommendations and statements supporting legal reform. </p>
