            <h2 id="the-links-between-religion-and-corporal-punishment-of-children">1. The links between religion and corporal punishment of children</h2>
          <p>Corporal punishment of children occurs globally and in all societies. It takes place in many settings including
the home, in schools and institutions, care systems such as foster and day care, and on the streets. In some
countries children and young people can still be legally whipped or beaten as punishment for an offence.
Children in situations such as forced or bonded labour, domestic labour, or those being abused in prostitution
and trafficking are also at risk.</p>
<p>
The mistaken belief that corporal punishment is an effective form of discipline for children is widespread,
and many people do not view corporal punishment as the act of violence that it is. This attitude is not only
held by individuals but is widespread in societies and endorsed at state government level. Religious views often
underpin this belief with reliance by some communities on particular interpretations of their religious texts.
Some societies retain the use of corporal punishment in traditional
justice systems and through religious law such as Shariah or Muslim
law. Although many states have developed child protection laws they
continue to authorise corporal punishment of children. 
</p>
<p>
Religious justification for corporal punishment is complex and
presents a challenge for those campaigning for law reform. For centuries
religious teachings and various theological positions held by some
religious groups have been used to justify corporal punishment, and the
cultural environment of different religious communities has reinforced
the practice. In some cases the justification of corporal punishment
may be based on a literal reading and interpretation of ancient religious
texts.</p>
<p>
Some groups of Christians believe in the notion of “original sin” – a
belief that all children are born inherently bad and that it is therefore
the duty of parents to control the child’s behaviour and “break the
child’s will” through physical punishment. This attitude towards
children, when coupled with a belief that the Bible is beyond criticism
and contains divine instructions to physically punish children, means
that all the compelling research evidence and advances in child
development which condemn physical punishment make little impact.
</p>      </div>

<div>
            <h2 id="religion-and-the-law">2.Religion and the law</h2>
            <p>Corporal punishment occurs across all cultures and
religions and the tension between modern laws and
indigenous, religious and traditional customs and
authoritarian practices continues to hinder legal
reform and policies for the protection of children.
Lack of awareness of policies, rules and regulations
maintains the situation. Even in largely secular
societies corporal punishment of children is often
deeply rooted in cultural and traditional beliefs
and practices. Violence against children, including
corporal punishment, is also linked to inequality
in some societies where discrimination based on
caste, gender, disability and/or social class increases
children’s vulnerability to violence. Children are
usually at the bottom of hierarchical social structures and the last to receive justice.  </p>
            <p>Traditional common law defences allow parents and other adults the right to use “reasonable punishment”
or “lawful correction” against children. In some countries these defences are written into the law; in others the
law is silent but corporal punishment is accepted. Many countries have adopted the ancient English common
law defence of “reasonable chastisement” which spread throughout the world during the nineteenth century
largely through colonisation, military occupation and some Christian missionary teaching. Prohibiting all
corporal punishment requires the explicit removal of all such defences. </p>
            <p>For centuries corporal punishment has carried with it the mask of religious credibility in religious schools,
institutions and family homes. But in recent times it has been widely exposed as dangerous and unjust and
incompatible with the teachings of the major world
religions. As evidence of past institutional and
family abuse has come to light, men and women
who endured corporal punishment in childhood
have revealed their deep sense of humiliation and
spoken about the trauma and psychological damage
they sustained. Others have trivialised childhood
experiences of being hurt by parents and teachers,
out of loyalty to their parents. As adults they may
go to great lengths to protect their parents from
painful memories of being physically punished as
children. They may hide their true feelings with the
comment: “It never did me any harm – it made me
the person I am today.”  </p>
            <p>The persistent social and legal acceptance of corporal punishment as a form of discipline or “correction”, and
its acceptance by adults and children as an inevitable part of childhood, means that this violence often goes
unreported. But corporal punishment is never acceptable. It breaches children’s fundamental human rights to
equal protection and its legality means that children, the smallest and most vulnerable people in society, have
less protection from assault than adults. </p>
            </div>


<div>
            <h2 id="religion-and-reform">3.Religion and reform</h2>
<p>Hitting children and causing them pain is incompatible with the values expressed in most religious teachings,
which are very similar to the human rights principles of respect for human dignity, equality, justice and
non-violence. Religious values helped inform the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and generations of
religious leaders and scholars have played a significant role in defending human rights. These universal values
are shared by most religious communities and a growing number of religious leaders have recognised the need
to highlight and put them into action towards eliminating all corporal punishment of children.</p>
<p>Religious leaders at a global consultation in Toledo, Spain, in 2006 acknowledged that many faith-based
institutions have been responsible for acts of violence against children. They recommended that leaders of
the major world religions should address the problem as a matter of urgency. Their recommendations and
commitments were incorporated into a declaration (the Kyoto Declaration) endorsed at the Eighth World
Assembly of Religions for Peace held in Kyoto, Japan in 2006. It states:</p>
<block-quote>
“We must acknowledge that our religious communities have not fully upheld their obligations to
protect our children from violence. Through omission, denial and silence, we have at times tolerated,
perpetuated and ignored the reality of violence against children in homes, families, institutions and
communities, and not actively confronted the suffering that this violence causes. Even as we have not
fully lived up to our responsibilities in this regard, we believe that religious communities must be part
of the solution to eradicating violence against children, and we commit ourselves to take leadership in
our religious communities and the broader society.”
</block-quote>
            </div>
      

<div>
            <h2 id="religious-leaders-have-a-key-role-to-play">4.Religious leaders have a key role to play </h2>
<p>Five billion of the world’s six billion people are said to profess a religious belief. As members of one of the
largest groups in society, religious leaders are in a position to engage with communities and to mobilise multireligious action to end all forms of violence against children, including corporal punishment. </p>
<p>Religious leaders often have extensive local, regional, national and global networks which provide
opportunities for raising awareness and changing attitudes within and beyond their local communities. They
are in a unique position to be advocates for children and agents for change.</p>
<p>While some religious leaders continue to teach their communities that corporal punishment of children
is natural or even a duty in childrearing, a growing number of religious leaders publicly acknowledge that
corporal punishment is at odds with and debases their religious principles and core religious beliefs. Many are
involved in the movement for the elimination and prohibition of corporal punishment and regard ending this
injustice towards children as a religious imperative. </p>
<p>The above mentioned Kyoto Declaration was endorsed by more than 800 religious leaders from all the
major world religions. As its preamble states:</p>
<block-quote>“We find strong consensus across our religious traditions about the inherent dignity of every person,
including children. This requires that we reject all forms of violence against children and protect and
promote the sanctity of life in every stage of a child’s development..."</block-quote>
