            <h2 id="the-prevalence-of-corporal-punishment">1.The prevalence of corporal punishment</h2>
          <p>Although corporal punishment occurs in almost all societies worldwide, gathering
accurate data on its prevalence is difficult because so much violence against children takes place behind closed
doors – and it is especially difficult to obtain information on physical punishment of babies and very young
children. The only way of getting a near-accurate picture of children’s real experiences of corporal punishment
is through interview research with children, with appropriate ethical safeguards. Information on violence
against babies and small children can only be gained through interviews with parents in situations of trust and
confidentiality. The lack of visibility is one of the reasons why eliminating this commonplace form of violence
against children has for too long had such a low priority</p>

<p>But the visibility of corporal punishment is increasing, with a growing number of research studies revealing
the extent and enormity of the problem. According to statistics from UNICEF on child discipline in 35
low- and middle-income countries, in 2005-2006 three out of four children aged 2-14 experienced physical
punishment and/or psychological aggression in their homes during the month before the survey, ranging from
38% in Bosnia and Herzegovina to almost 95% in Yemen. The rate of violent discipline was above 70% in
three quarters of the countries surveyed and above 80% in half of them; Bosnia and Herzegovina was the only
country with a rate below 50%.</p>
<p>There have been many other national studies. For example, qualitative research with over 500 children in
Cambodia revealed that over 80% were punished in the home, commonly with implements including sticks,
electric cables, belts and chains.13 In 2005, Tearfund, a leading charity working in partnership with Christian
agencies and churches worldwide to address poverty and injustice, conducted a large scale study of children’s
attitudes towards and experiences of corporal punishment in Cambodia: most children believed that being
beaten by teachers and parents was acceptable in some circumstances, and in a survey of more than 1,300 12-15
year olds, 51% of the boys and 36% of the girls reported being beaten by their parents, 35% and 24% by their
teachers.</p>

     <h2 id="the-impact-of-corporal-punishment">2.The impact of corporal punishment</h2>
     <p>Corporal punishment violates a child’s physical, emotional and spiritual integrity. The impact of corporal
punishment is often discussed in terms of physical, psychological, behavioural and societal consequences but
it is difficult to separate these as they may each in turn have an impact on the other. Physical injury such as
damage to a child’s developing brain can have a psychological impact such as cognitive delay or emotional
difficulties. Behavioural effects may lead to alcohol and drug abuse. Corporal punishment can have short and
long-term effects on development and health which not only impact on the child and family but ultimately on
society as a whole, including welfare, mental health and justice systems.</p>

<h4>Physical effects</h4>
<p>Children who are physically punished may suffer injuries which leave permanent damage. Tragically, corporal
punishment causes the death of a significant number of children every year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Boxing on the ear can damage the ear drum.</li>
<li>Shaking can cause whiplash injury, blindness,brain damage or even death.</li>
<li>Hitting can injure the sciatic nerve, pelvis, coccyx, genitals or spine.</li>
<li>Hitting a child’s hands can injure bones, blood vessels, joints and ligaments and can cause premature osteoarthritis</li>
<li>A child who is hit can accidentally fall or be pushed over and suffer serious injury</li>
</ul>

<h4>Effects on growth and development</h4>
<p>Corporal punishment can have serious negative effects on the growth and development of the child. There is
evidence to suggest that exposure to violence in early childhood alters the developing brain by interfering with
normal neuro-developmental processes.</p>
<p>In his paper Violence and Childhood, How Persisting Fear Can Alter the Developing Child’s Brain (2001),
Bruce Perry considers one of the many perspectives from which to examine the impact of violence on children,
violence-related neurodevelopmental changes and functional consequences. He states: “… Exposure to violence
activates a set of threat responses in the child’s developing brain; in turn, excess activation of the neural systems
involved in the threat responses can alter the developing brain; these alterations may manifest as functional
changes in emotional, behavioural and cognitive functioning. The roots of violence-related problems, therefore,
can be found in the adaptive responses to threat, present during the violent experiences.” </p>


<h4>Psychological effects</h4>
<p>Corporal punishment can be psychologically damaging and may induce a sense of low self worth, sadness, fear,
shame, anger, an inability to trust, anxiety, despair, depression or withdrawal. Depression may induce a person
to abuse alcohol or use illicit drugs.</p>

<h4>Effects on behaviour</h4>
<p>Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that both girls and boys who have been physically abused before the age of five have
been found to be aggressive and have difficulty with managing their behaviour and forming peer relationships in later childhood and
into adolescence, even when the abuse has ceased</p>

<h4>Effects on society</h4>
<p>Research involving adults has shown
that having been physically punished
in childhood is associated with later
antisocial and criminal behaviour
and adult abuse of one’s own child
or spouse; physical punishment was
also negatively associated with mental
health.42 The consequences and costs
for society in both the short and
long-term include those associated
with childcare, welfare, mental health
and justice systems.</p>

  <h2 id="the-importance-of-legal-reform">3.The importance of legal reform</h2>
          <p>Prohibiting corporal punishment by law is a vital measure which recognises a child’s human rights to respect
for human dignity and physical integrity and to equal protection under the law. Law reform provides a clear
basis for child protection. It makes it clear to all people working with and caring for children, including child
and family organisations, faith-based organisations, education providers and employers, that hitting a child is
no more lawful or acceptable than hitting anyone else. Law reform should be accompanied by public education
to raise awareness of children’s rights and to provide information for parents, teachers and others about
positive, non-violent forms of discipline</p>
           <p>It is important to emphasise that the
aim of law reform is not to prosecute
parents for a “mild smack”. The primary
purpose of the law is to set a standard
and work towards changing attitudes
and practices so that children can
grow and develop free from the fear of
violence. Given children’s dependent
status, and the unique relationships
within the family, prosecution of parents should happen only if it is considered necessary to protect the child from significant harm and to be in
the child’s best interests. </p>
            <p>Although governments have a primary obligation to protect children, all adults have a responsibility to end
violence against children. Religious leaders, faith-based organisations and community groups can play a key
part in working together to support parents, carers and teachers and to give guidance on non-violent discipline.
Above all, religious leaders can be role models and lead by example: by treating children with respect and
compassion and actively promoting non-violence they set a standard for others to follow. Ending all corporal
punishment is a key step towards eliminating all other forms of violence against children. This requires law
reform and other measures.</p>
             <p>No country can say it has prohibited corporal punishment in all settings until it has passed legislation which
does this. And in order to make a difference to children’s daily lives that legislation must be accompanied by
implementation and prevention strategies, including public education on positive non-violent discipline.</p>
  


  <h2 id="progress-towards-prohibition-worldwide">4. Progress towards prohibition worldwide</h2>
<p>Corporal punishment of children is a global problem and children in almost every state in the world endure
the humiliation and pain of being hit by adults. Because acceptance of corporal punishment is so widespread
and frequently institutionalised, politicians and others often fail to view the problem of corporal punishment
as one of equality and human rights</p>
<p>The recommendations of the United Nations Secretary-General’s Study on Violence against Children
(2006) urged all states to take urgent action to prohibit all forms of violence against children, including
corporal punishment.</p>
<p>During the last decade there
has been significant global progress
towards achieving prohibition.
By the end of December 2010,
29 countries worldwide had
enacted legislation which prohibits
corporal punishment of children
in all settings, including within
the family. Governments in at least
another 23 countries have made a
commitment to prohibition and/
or are considering Bills in their
parliaments. But the majority of
children are not yet protected from
all corporal punishment in their homes, with 95.5% of the global child population living in countries where it
is lawful for parents to hit them in the name of “discipline”.
