				Mission and values
			</h3>
			<p>
				Monday Charitable Trust (MCT) aims to improve life chances of disadvantaged and often marginalised groups in the UK. We do this by supporting UK registered charities that work to tackle disadvantage, mainly in the fields of housing, education, welfare and social mobility. We  fund programmes which address or seek to identify the root causes of issues, as we believe that such programmes will deliver the greatest social impact over the long term.
